# library-app [view live](https://bundybujet.github.io/bookListApp/)

A library app following I made as a project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The clean and beautiful layout is thanks to [Bootswatch Yeti](https://bootswatch.com/yeti/)

## Requirements

- A _render()_ function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page
- A form that allows user to add new books
- A delete button.

## Object Constructors

The focus of this project was to create this app using Object Constructors and
being able to reduce the code by doing so.

## LocalStorage

I was asked to do it locally but it was a fine opportunity to learn and apply
LocalStorage. I learned about the basics of it using the Mozilla documentation
and also learned about JSON _stringify_ and _parse_ methods which made handling the
data extremely easy.

I also learned how to approach a project from a design perspective, knowing how to break it down to steps and
then addressing every steps accordingly.
